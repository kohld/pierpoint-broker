President Donald Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports, has led to sharp declines across major indices.\n\n**Global Market Impact:**\n\n- **Asia:** Chinese markets have been notably affected, with the CSI300 Index dropping 1.8% and the Shanghai Composite falling 1.3%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 3.5%, with its Tech Index losing 4.5%.

([home.saxo](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/macro/market-quick-take---13-october-2025-13102025?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Rare Earth and Semiconductors:** In contrast, Chinese rare earth and semiconductor stocks have risen, given their strategic importance amid the trade conflict.

No clear U.S. premarket winners; volatility is very high.\n\n**Logical Next Steps:**\n1. **Calculate Cost Basis:** Analyze trade history for NVDA, QQQ, and PEP to check if current prices are above entry (candidates for profit-taking) or below (potential cut).\n2. **Risk Management:** Consider reducing tech exposure if NVDA and/or QQQ are at risk of a deeper selloff, protecting solid gains already booked for this run.\n3. **Tactical Moves:** Current market is not ideal for new buys; focus on holding defensive positions (PEP) and keeping high cash reserves for possible later opportunities.\n4. **Action Plan:** \n    - Hold PEP as it is defensive unless a sudden price surge suggests a sell.\n    - Prepare to trim or fully exit NVDA/QQQ if cost basis indicates there are still gains or if losses are manageable (to preserve capital).\n    - Do not deploy more cash until market volatility decreases or reversal/capitulation signs appear.\n\nWould you like me to proceed by analyzing your NVDA, QQQ, and PEP cost basis from your trade history to suggest exact sell/hold actions, or do you want to review specific tickers for potential intraday reversals?",
