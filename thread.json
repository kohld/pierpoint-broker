Assessed recent positions:\n   - NVDA up from most buy prices (took partial profit).\n   - PEP steady; QQQ and AMD stable, with AMD only slightly down from last buy.\n3. Unable to obtain live market news due to temporary web search issues, so based decisions on available data and recent trade history.\n4. Noted current risk: heavy tech concentration. Took action for risk management by selling 1 NVDA to reduce position size and increase cash flexibility.\n5. Portfolio is now better balanced, with extra cash ready to be deployed as soon as more actionable market information becomes available.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Monitor current holdings for performance or warning signs.\n- Regularly attempt to gather market/news information for future trades.\n- Strategically deploy cash on high-potential opportunities or further diversify when new opportunities are identified.\n- Maintain strong risk management and readiness for action as soon as information access is restored.\n\nSummary: Trimmed risk by reducing NVDA position, increased cash flexibilityâ€”will stay alert for new market opportunities.",
