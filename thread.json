(AAPL):** Trading at $248.35, up $0.55 (0.22%) from the previous close.\n- **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT):** Trading at $451.14, up $7.00 (1.58%) from the previous close.\n- **Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL):** Trading at $330.54, up $2.16 (0.66%) from the previous close.\n- **Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN):** Trading at $234.34, up $2.98 (1.29%) from the previous close.\n- **Tesla Inc. (TSLA):** Trading at $449.36, up $17.80 (4.13%) from the previous close.\n\n**Breaking News:**\n\n- The 56th World Economic Forum is currently underway in Davos, Switzerland, from January 19 to 23, 2026. The forum features major speeches by world leaders, including Mark Carney, Ursula von der Leyen, and Donald Trump. Notably, President Trump launched the 'Board of Peace' with a signing ceremony in Davos. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/56th_World_Economic_Forum?utm_source=openai))\n\n- On January 21, 2026, U.S. stock markets rebounded after President Trump announced he would not proceed with proposed tariffs on European countries related to Greenland, following a deal framework concerning the island. This announcement positively impacted investor sentiment, leading to a 1.2% rise across major stock indexes. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/b1c643e7f04eea26107f949e60f2dadd?utm_source=openai))\n\n- The earnings calendar for the week of January 19–23, 2026, includes key financial reports from major U.S. publicly traded companies. Notably, Netflix reported better-than-expected earnings of $0.56 per share, up 30.2% year-over-year, and revenue of $12.05 billion, an 18% increase. Netflix ended the year with a record 325 million paid subscribers and forecasts 13% revenue growth in 2026. ([kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/17494/next-week-earnings-calendar-stocks?utm_source=openai))\n\nPlease note that stock market conditions are dynamic, and it's advisable to consult financial advisors or trusted financial news sources for the most current information.

Initial Assessment:\n   - Portfolio before trades: NVDA (4), FNKO (25), HL (4), RDW (34), TSLA (1), NFLX (3), €43.74 cash.\n   - All stocks except NVDA were at or just below entry prices, with little momentum.\n\n2. Market Scan Results:\n   - TSLA is a top gainer today (4%+ move).\n   - NFLX has just posted stellar earnings: EPS up 30%, record revenue and subscriber growth, and strong guidance.\n   - Market sentiment is generally positive.\n\n3. Trade Execution:\n   - Sold all shares of FNKO, HL, and RDW at break-even, maximizing cash for higher potential moves. Total post-sale cash: €390.54.\n\n4. Strategic Reallocation:\n   - Evaluated buying TSLA (1 share) or adding to NFLX (up to 5 shares).\n   - Chose to increase NFLX position due to extremely strong earnings momentum.\n   - Bought 5 more shares of NFLX at €71.13 each (total: €355.65 + €1 fee), leaving €34.89 cash.\n\n5. New Portfolio:\n   - NVDA: 4 shares\n   - TSLA: 1 share\n   - NFLX: 8 shares (substantially increased exposure to positive catalyst)\n   - Cash: €34.89\n\n6. Rationale:\n   - Consolidated into high-momentum, high-conviction growth names with recent positive catalysts (especially NFLX).\n   - Small cash reserve remains for flexibility or fast trading response if needed.\n\nPlan:\n- Hold these high-momentum names and monitor for strong upside moves.\n- Watch for signs of over-extension or reversal for potential profit-taking.\n- Stay alert to breaking news and keep searching for the next opportunity as market dynamics shift.\n\nPortfolio is now optimized for immediate growth based on today’s news and trends. Ready to reassess at the next market cycle!",
