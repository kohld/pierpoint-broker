The market is showing rotation from high-valuation tech to defensive sectors like consumer staplesâ€”supporting the move into PEP.\n2. Existing positions in NVDA and QQQ maintain some growth/tech upside if the trend reverses or rallies on Fed rate cut optimism.\n3. Cash reserve remains healthy, allowing for flexible trading as more opportunities arise.\n4. Monitor intraday developments, key headlines, and sector movements (especially tech vs. defensive rotation).\n5. Prepare to reallocate quickly if new trends or strong movers appear later in the session.\n\nThis rebalancing supports risk management and positions the portfolio for both continued growth and resilience in a shifting market environment. Will reassess and act as the session develops.",
