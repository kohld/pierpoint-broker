Market Momentum:\n   - Unable to access up-to-the-minute news or top movers due to technical issues with web search.\n   - No immediate sell triggers from price dataâ€”positions are near entry points or in growth sectors.\n\n3. Risk Assessment:\n   - Portfolio is tech/semiconductor-heavy, which brings potential for volatility but also growth.\n   - You have some cash to deploy, but not enough for significant new positions without selling current winners.\n\n4. Strategic Plan:\n   - Do not make any trades this run due to lack of fresh market-wide signals and in absence of compelling new trends.\n   - Remain ready to sell or diversify when stronger momentum or opportunity presents itself.\n   - Maintain current positions and continue scanning for market updates in subsequent sessions.\n\nYou are in a strong position. For now, the wise move is to monitor and protect gains while being prepared to adjust quickly when new data or momentum emerges. No trades will be executed this cycle due to lack of compelling actionable information.",
