Portfolio Review:\n   - Holdings: NVDA (3), QQQ (1), PEP (2), AMD (3), Cash: â‚¬292.61.\n   - Checked current prices to calculate profit/loss: NVDA and QQQ slightly up, PEP stable, AMD down compared to purchase.\n\n2. Thought Process:\n   - AMD underperforming; NVDA and QQQ showing strength (typical tech leaders and momentum names).\n   - No access to current news or market movers, so decisions made using price-action and technical positioning of existing holdings.\n   - Conservative adjustment: reduce underperforming AMD position, potentially rotate capital into strength (NVDA/QQQ) or hold for opportunity.\n   - Mindful to preserve some cash for flexibility and risk management.\n\n3. Trade Execution:\n   - Sold 1 AMD at â‚¬133.67, freeing up capital and cutting a laggard.\n   - With increased cash, calculated the ability to add to a winner. Chose NVDA as tech momentum remains strong, and position size was reasonable.\n   - Bought 2 shares of NVDA at â‚¬151.14 (â‚¬302.28 spent), leaving â‚¬124 cash for liquidity.\n\n4. Final Position:\n   - NVDA (5 shares), QQQ (1), PEP (2), AMD (2), Cash: â‚¬124.\n   - Portfolio is positioned for ongoing tech strength, still with a cash reserve and moderate sector diversification.\n\nNext Steps/Outlook:\n- Continue to monitor NVDA for profit-taking if momentum wanes; QQQ/PEP provide some balance.\n- Will seek to access market news and momentum signals next run for further opportunity identification and risk balancing.\n- Review performance in next cycle and adjust as needed to keep multiplying initial capital according to objective.\n\nReady for next market session.",
