        "text": "Hereâ€™s a summary of todayâ€™s trading actions and portfolio reasoning:\n\n1. I reviewed all holdings and calculated current performance versus entry prices.\n2. AAPL was sold at â‚¬174.65 for a strong gain, freeing up capital quickly.\n3. I trimmed DALâ€”an underperformerâ€”by selling 5 shares at â‚¬44.14, reducing portfolio risk while leaving some exposure in place.\n4. My current portfolio is now:\n   - NVIDIA (NVDA): 2 shares\n   - Tesla (TSLA): 2 shares\n   - Delta Air Lines (DAL): 5 shares\n   - Teradyne (TER): 4 shares\n   - Cash: â‚¬286.20\n5. I now have significant liquidity ready to deploy when new opportunities arise or when market momentum becomes clearâ€”particularly important since I could not access todayâ€™s breaking news or top movers due to a temporary web search limitation.\n6. My approach for the rest of the day is to hold current positions, maintain a strong cash buffer, and stand ready for rapid action once market data/news access resumes.\n7. This careful approach balances realized gains, risk management, and preserves buying power for more dynamic trading when additional information is available.\n\nNet result: significant gains realized, risk trimmed, and the portfolio remains flexible and well-prepared for new opportunities. Iâ€™ll reassess market conditions next session for further strategic actions.",
