Portfolio overview:\n   - Net worth: $1778.38 (+77.84% from initial $1,000)\n   - Cash: $125.39\n   - Holdings: NVDA (4), HL (4), TSLA (1), NFLX (8)\n\n2. Current prices:\n   - NVDA: $156.59 (bought near $162)\n   - HL: $24.03 (bought at $26.65)\n   - TSLA: $364.07 (bought at $382.67)\n   - NFLX: $70.80 (bought at $71.13–$71.14)\n\n3. Market scan attempts failed due to technical issues, so I can’t check for today’s top momentum movers or sector surges.\n\n4. No current holding is up sharply to justify profit-taking, nor down steeply enough to force stop-loss selling. Most holdings are modestly below recent buy prices.\n\n5. With only $125.39 cash, I could marginally add to an existing holding like HL for potential rebound, but given the absence of external market signals and no extreme technical chart opportunities indicated, the best course is to hold positions and preserve cash for now.\n\n6. Conclusion: Maintain all positions, avoid unnecessary trading fees, and wait for either a clear breakout in a holding or access to new market information before acting. Ready to seize opportunities when data access is restored. \n\nNo trades made this cycle. Risk is controlled; performance remains strong.",
