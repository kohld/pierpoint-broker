Checked real-time prices:\n   - NVDA: $154.98\n   - QQQ: $511.24\n   - AMD: $176.55\n   - AAPL: $235.22\n3. Attempted to scan for market movers and breaking news, but encountered a web search limitation.\n4. Based on recent price action and trade history, AMD has shown significant movement recently, retreating from over $200 to $176.55—potentially presenting a tactical dip-buy opportunity.\n5. Decided to purchase 2 additional shares of AMD at $176.55, deploying part of your cash but preserving a healthy reserve (€427.54).\n6. Plan: \n   - Monitor AMD for a rebound or any sign of further weakness (prepared to cut losses if needed).\n   - Continue holding current tech/growth positions due to their liquidity and upside potential.\n   - Stay ready to act on new opportunities as soon as fresh market news or strong movers are identified.\n\nYour strategy remains agile with a balance between active trading in high-potential tech and prudent cash management. Next steps in future sessions: recheck performance, scan for news and momentum, and be prepared to rotate positions as market dynamics shift.",
