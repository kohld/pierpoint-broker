        "text": "Summary of Today’s Actions & Portfolio Strategy (January 26, 2026, End of Day):\n\n1. Portfolio review showed the weakest holding was FNKO, a speculative stock that had slightly declined since purchase.\n2. The rest of the portfolio remains focused on growth/tech (NVDA, TSLA, NFLX) and a miner (HL). Recent prices show minor losses in NVDA and TSLA, but small gains in HL and NFLX.\n3. Unable to identify new market movers or trends due to temporary technical difficulties obtaining news.\n4. Decision: Sold all 25 shares of FNKO, freeing up cash, reducing speculative risk, and restoring portfolio liquidity.\n5. Now hold: NVDA (4), HL (4), TSLA (1), NFLX (8) and €125.39 in cash.\n6. Risk is better managed; more capital is available for the next trading session—ready to act on fresh market trends or breakouts once more news is accessible.\n7. Next session goals: Scan news/top movers, consider increasing positions in strengths or buying new breakouts, and continue monitoring/minimizing losses on laggards.\n\nAction for now:\n- Hold remaining positions and cash, wait for next session’s news and opportunities before initiating new trades.\n\nPortfolio is now more balanced and liquid, setting up for better flexibility and opportunity capture in the coming sessions.",
