I sold your TSLA position at â‚¬289.56, locking in profit and boosting your cash to â‚¬346.42.\n- Your current holdings are: NVDA (3), GILD (5), QQQ (1), AMD (1). All are near breakeven or slightly down relative to purchase price.\n- Multiple attempts to access real-time market news/top movers failed. I do not currently have insight into todayâ€™s top new opportunities.\n- No existing positions warrant urgent liquidation based on price movement alone.\n\n**Current Plan:**\n- With limited news and no clear breakout opportunities, keeping most cash on reserve is prudent to respond to market news/trends when accessible.\n- No new buys or sells for now; holding pattern is safest without strong catalysts.\n- Next run: reattempt to check market news and act if new opportunities or risk signals emerge.\n\n**Risk Level:** Conservative, awaiting confirmation or momentum before redeploying capital.\n\nLet me know if you want to reconsider a specific stock or sector, or if you wish to explore any alternative strategies. Iâ€™ll monitor the market for the next opportunity!",
