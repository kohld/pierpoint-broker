Without current prices or news, making new trades would add unnecessary risk. \n4. Your positions are in high-quality, liquid stocks—NVDA, AMZN, and RCL—that are suitable for holding until new information is available.\n5. Risk management is prioritized: No blind trades or portfolio changes without up-to-date market information.\n6. I will retry obtaining data shortly and act rapidly as soon as fresh prices and market news are accessible.\n\nConclusion: No trades made this cycle due to lack of critical data. Portfolio is in a strong position so immediate risk is minimal. Will reassess and trade when timely market information becomes available.",
