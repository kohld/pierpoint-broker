Market Action:\n   - All web searches for external momentum/news failed, so I operated using internal price data and risk management rules.\n   - NVDA, QQQ, AMZN, and GOOGL represent diversified, high-momentum tech and growth plays.\n   - Bought 1 share of NVDA at €155.71 to increase exposure to a leading AI/semiconductor stock with strong long-term and short-term breakout potential.\n   - Kept some cash in reserve (~€82) for flexibility.\n\n3. Risk & Positioning:\n   - Locked in significant profit while recycling capital into a high-quality name.\n   - Portfolio remains diversified across leading tech sectors, balancing risk and potential upside.\n   - No full over-concentration; cash remains on hand for emergencies or swift new opportunities.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Monitor existing holdings for profit-taking or loss-cut signals.\n- Attempt news/momentum scans again in future sessions for new ideas.\n- Remain disciplined in position sizing, risk management, and cash allocation.\n\nActions this cycle:\n- Sold KSS (+16% gain realized)\n- Bought 1 more NVDA\n\nStanding by for the next trading window and market developments!",
