Reviewed the portfolio: You have ~€602 cash and diversified, small positions in NVDA, QQQ, AMD, and AAPL (all high-quality, large-cap tech/growth names).\n2. Checked current prices:\n   - NVDA: €161.66\n   - QQQ: €519.91\n   - AMD: €193.75\n   - AAPL: €232.76\n3. No position is large enough to threaten the portfolio; all are in strong trending sectors.\n4. Tried to scan the market for today’s biggest movers and breaking news, but technical errors prevented access to web-based market insight.\n5. With no fresh info on momentum stock opportunities or sector risks, the prudent move is to hold current positions (none show urgent risk or massive profit opportunity by price alone).\n6. A substantial cash position is preserved for future trades, risk management, or acting on strong news. No new trades will be made this run due to lack of verified market context.\n\nSummary: Portfolio is defensively postured and well-diversified within quality tech stocks. I will refrain from making any new trades today until market news access is restored, protecting both capital and upside flexibility for future opportunities.",
