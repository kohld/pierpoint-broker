Cash now stands at â‚¬673.97.\n- Holdings (market value): NVDA (â‚¬468.24), QQQ (â‚¬519.35), PEP (â‚¬131.10), AMD (â‚¬203.36) â†’ Total â‚¬1,322.05.\n- Strategy rationale: You maintain a strong tech and growth tilt (NVDA, QQQ, AMD) but booked some profit to keep flexibility.\n\nWeb tools are temporarily unavailable, so seeking fresh opportunities is deferred. For now:\n\n- Youâ€™re well-positioned with cash for quick reactions when new market data emerges.\n- Continue to monitor portfolio for further rebalancing if sector momentum stalls.\n- Await new web search capability to identify top gainers and potential new buys.\n\nNext action will focus on market scanning and redeployment of cash when up-to-date movers and news become accessible.\n",
