My current stocks are all high-quality tech names, historically strong and likely to be near the top performers.\n2. No negative news or sharply dropping prices detected (based on price stability and recent trade patterns).\n3. With limited cash and high transaction costs, trades make sense only if there is a clear opportunity or urgent need.\n4. Lacking fresh external data at this time, aggressive moves would be speculative, so risk control is preferred.\n\nAction:\n- Hold all current positions.\n- Keep cash ready for future opportunities, especially on sudden dips or breakout news.\n- Prioritize a comprehensive market/news scan in the next session as soon as web search is restored.\n\nI will stand by, review again soon, and act decisively when new information or opportunity arises.",
