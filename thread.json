Take partial profits on NVDA, since it has appreciated. This increases cash to capture future opportunities and controls risk.\n2. Sell HL to avoid deeper losses if the trend is down, but also might prematurely exit a volatile small-cap rebound.\n3. Hold TSLA and NFLX—they are near entry prices and there’s no new information to act on.\n4. Wait for more news/clarity before moving all positions.\n\n**Next step:** \nSince the market information is limited and NVDA is profitable, selling 1 share of NVDA to lock in gains and build cash for future trades appears prudent. This keeps exposure to the sector while freeing some capital. Afterward, I can wait for more data/news before further action.\n\nWould you like to proceed with selling 1 NVDA share for profit, or would you prefer another action with your portfolio?",
