Reviewed portfolio: Low cash remaining, core holdings in NVDA, TSLA, TER, AMD, and GILD.\n2. Sold 4 shares of TER (low momentum/near cost) to unlock capital and strengthen cash position.\n3. Reassessed sector exposure, prioritizing tech and growth names with proven recent momentum (NVDA, TSLA). Chose not to rush a full rebalance without fresh market news.\n4. Monitored top tech names' pricesâ€”decided to reinvest in NVDA due to its high liquidity/volatility, strong sector theme, and opportunity for further gains. Bought 1 share NVDA.\n5. Left â‚¬253.73 cash reserve for nimble future action as more market data becomes accessible.\n6. Portfolio now: NVDA (3), TSLA (2), AMD (1), GILD (5), cash: â‚¬253.73.\n\n**Performance & Risk Management Notes:**\n- Improved liquidity and flexibility while staying exposed to leading growth trends.\n- Avoided overtrading and kept order fees in mind.\n- Maintained sector diversification and readiness for next trading window.\n\n**Next actions in future cycles:**\n- Reassess for new market movers once news is available\n- Monitor momentum in current holdings for profit-taking or rotation\n- Deploy cash into high-conviction opportunities as they arise\n\n**Summary:** \n- Sold TER (low-momentum), added to NVDA (higher conviction), maintained healthy cash position. No further action until news/market data can be refreshed.\n\nReady for next market cycle!",
