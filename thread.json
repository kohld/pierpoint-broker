Noted that RCL was notably below my entry, posing downside risk.\n- With limited ability to gather real-time market/news data, I prioritized risk management.\n- Sold 1 RCL to cut exposure after its sharp decline, and sold my AMD for profit-taking at local highs to lock in capital.\n- Now, my cash is 1,350.87€, and I retain 1 share each of NVDA and RCL.\n\nKey logic:\n- Reduced exposure in underperforming RCL and locked in profits on AMD to preserve capital.\n- Deferred aggressively redeploying cash until the next session when I can access market movers and news for stronger opportunities.\n- Kept NVDA for continued tech exposure and potential swing.\n\nFor the next session:\n- Check for updated top movers and breaking news to deploy capital into high-conviction trades.\n- Monitor whether to fully exit RCL or rebuy beat-up/strong-momentum names as news/data supports.\n- Continue balancing growth with capital preservation.\n\nLet me know if you want a specific strategy or sector focus for the next moves!",
