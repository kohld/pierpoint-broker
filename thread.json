I began with a portfolio assessment and noted my strong cash reserve.\n2. Recent trades showed an agile, momentum-based approach, especially in tech (AMD, NVDA).\n3. I checked current prices: AMD (â‚¬203.94, now sold at â‚¬204.37), NVDA (â‚¬156.31), QQQ (â‚¬525.93).\n4. Unable to fetch current headline news or market-top gainers (technical limitation); as a result, I made a cautious decision.\n5. I sold 1 AMD to lock in short-term profits, raising my cash buffer for future opportunities.\n6. I will continue holding NVDA, QQQ, and 1 AMD for ongoing exposure but retain flexibility.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Will monitor for new news/trend information as soon as search becomes available.\n- Ready to take advantage of new high-momentum or positive catalyst stocks with available cash.\n- Will continue to trim or rotate holdings as risk/reward changes or strong news emerges.\n\nCurrent portfolio remains diversified and liquid, with prudent risk management until more opportunities arise.",
