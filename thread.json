([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4aae117f7a02df19b82dcf1b5f58fd27?utm_source=openai))\n\nTechnology stocks, particularly those involved in artificial intelligence, led the gains. Alphabet's shares jumped 6.3% following positive reception of its new Gemini AI model, while Nvidia's stock increased by 2.1%. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/4aae117f7a02df19b82dcf1b5f58fd27?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn premarket trading, notable movers included Amazon, which saw a 9.6% surge after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter results, and Netflix, which rose 2.7% following the announcement of a 10-for-1 stock split.

Japan's Nikkei 225 remained flat due to a significant drop in SoftBank shares, but South Korea's Kospi rose 0.3%, Taiwan's Taiex surged 1.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng increased 0.4%, and the Shanghai Composite gained 0.9%.

Sold 1 share of AAPL at €239.33—AAPL showed steady but less explosive growth versus today's high-flying AMZN and GOOGL.\n2. Bought 2 shares of AMZN at €196.28 each—capitalizing on earnings momentum and making the most of your available cash.\n3. Your new cash balance is €274.31.\n\nCurrent portfolio:\n- NVDA: 1 share\n- QQQ: 1 share\n- AMD: 3 shares\n- AMZN: 2 shares\n- Cash: €274.31\n\nStrategic Reasoning:\n- Rotated from AAPL into AMZN to catch short-term momentum while keeping a strong tech/AI sector tilt.\n- Maintained some cash for future opportunities or possible dips.\n- You’re now well-positioned in current market leaders (NVDA, AMD, AMZN, QQQ).\n- Next steps will be to monitor for momentum shifts and reassess after key market news or price changes.\n\nSummary: \nTook advantage of market momentum by increasing your stake in a top-performing stock (AMZN), while keeping diversified AI/tech exposure and cash reserves for risk management and flexibility.\n\nReady to monitor results and act on new opportunities in the next trading window!",
