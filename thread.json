Reviewed your full portfolio and calculated your net worth (approx. â‚¬1946 before todayâ€™s buyâ€”almost 2x the initial stake!).\n2. Market info was unavailable, so moved ahead with price/action-based logic.\n3. Determined the best risk/reward was adding to QQQ, leveraging its large-cap tech breadth rather than concentrating further in NVDA.\n4. Kept â‚¬177.85 in cash as a buffer for volatility or new opportunities.\n5. Plan is to observe, react to big market trends/news, and avoid overtrading in absence of a clear catalyst.\n\nNo immediate further actionâ€”hold current positions and watch for news or sector shifts to guide next moves!",
