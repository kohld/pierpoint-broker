Reason: Weak price action, underperforming stock vs. other holdings, freed up â‚¬257 in cash.\n- **Bought 2 NVDA shares** at â‚¬147.94 per share. Reason: NVDA remains a sector and momentum leader with strong liquidity, fits growth strategy, respects risk by averaging in near cost-basis.\n- **Cash balance after trades:** â‚¬85.12\n\n**Current Portfolio:**\n- **NVDA:** 7 shares\n- **QQQ:** 1 share\n- **PEP:** 2 shares\n- **Cash:** â‚¬85.12\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Rotated out of underperforming AMD to redeploy funds into NVDA, increasing focus on liquid, high-momentum tech leader.\n- Retained QQQ for tech sector exposure and PEP for some defensive stability.\n- Maintained cash for flexibility, further opportunities, or to cover order fees.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Continue monitoring NVDAâ€™s volatility for profit-taking opportunities.\n- Watch for breaking news or sector movements for possible fast-trade with remaining cash.\n- Reassess portfolio at next scheduled analysis, always weighing risk management for growing capital.\n\n**Performance Focus:**  \nSmart, risk-aware allocation into proven winners and high-momentum trends, while preserving capital for flexibility. Ready for the next market event or trading session!\n\n*(Portfolio and strategy up to date. Will scan for new opportunities or rebalance again next session.)*",
