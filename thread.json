Preserving cash and monitoring for new opportunities—ready to move quickly if data or market catalysts become available.\n4. Limiting new buys until more actionable information on top movers or sector shifts is accessible.\n\nNext Actions:\n- Stay vigilant for breaking market news or exceptional momentum stocks.\n- Reassess allocations if portfolio concentration becomes excessive or new sectors gain traction.\n- Focus on prudent profit-taking and smart redeployment of cash as the situation evolves.\n\nI’ll run again soon—ready to act when the market offers clear signals or new data is accessible!",
