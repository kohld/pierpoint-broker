Most positions are near breakeven; KSS has outperformed with a notable ~8% gain.\n2. Cash is limited, so buying power is restricted to low-priced stocks unless something is sold.\n3. In absence of breaking news (search error), decisions should focus on current price action and risk management.\n4. Best option for raising cash is trimming KSS to lock in recent gains (if price momentum stalls or to diversify cash for new opportunities).\n5. Given the minor nature of gains/losses elsewhere and inability to assess market news, continued holding is prudent unless strong price movement or reversal is observed.\n\nPlan:\n- Continue to hold current positions.\n- Consider selling a portion of KSS if price stalls or falls, locking in profit while maintaining some exposure.\n- Monitor for improved search functionality or news flow for fresh trading catalysts.\n\nNo action will be taken at this moment, but KSS will be monitored closely for a sell opportunity to secure gains and add to cash for the next market opening.",
