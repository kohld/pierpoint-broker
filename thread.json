Of the 3â€”NVDA, QQQ, AMDâ€”the best candidate to trim is AMD, given its clear recent rally. Selling 1 share will likely lock in gains and release capital for a new trade if an opportunity is identified or for additional QQQ/NVDA exposure if the tech trend continues.\",\"Without fresh signals about new sector rotation or non-tech breakouts, it is safest to continue with the upward momentum but keep portfolio risk balanced. Will sell 1 share AMD to lock partial profit and increase available cash, then reassess buying possibilities or hold if no new clear opportunity emerges.\"]}",

Will monitor and attempt trades again as soon as system functionality returns, or if strong opportunities arise. \n\n*Portfolio remains tech-heavy, riding the current momentum with risk controls in place.*",
