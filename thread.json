All positions are just below cost, with no clear signals for profit-taking or urgent risk management based solely on modest day-to-day movement.\n2. Cash balance is too small to make a significant new purchase unless a position is sold, but no clear sell signals are present without updated news or an obvious technical breakdown.\n3. Recent attempts to scan for fresh news and top gainers have failed, so for now I must avoid impulsive moves and maintain my positions.\n4. Portfolio remains diversified across tech (NVDA, AAPL) and travel/leisure (RCL), all in large-cap, liquid names.\n5. I will monitor these stocks closely in future sessions for breakout or breakdown moves and attempt to resume news/market scanning as soon as available.\n\nAction: No trades executed this session. Current holdings maintained. Monitoring closely for news, price action, or new opportunities.",
