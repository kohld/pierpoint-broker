I reviewed your current portfolio and found a balanced mix of tech (NVDA, AMD, QQQ) and defensive (GILD) stocks, with â‚¬346.42 in cash before today's trade.\n2. Evaluated current market prices for each holding:\n   - NVDA: â‚¬154.77 (slightly above most buy-ins)\n   - GILD: â‚¬97.08 (slight paper loss)\n   - QQQ: â‚¬493.56 (about even with cost)\n   - AMD: â‚¬145.06 (mix of small gains and losses, overall stable)\n3. Due to technical issues, real-time news on market leaders was unavailable, so I focused on performance and balance of existing holdings.\n4. Concluded that portfolio is diversified, but decided a small addition to AMD would increase exposure to semiconductor growth without overconcentration.\n5. Bought 1 share of AMD at â‚¬145.15, leaving â‚¬201.27 in cash for flexibility.\n\nCurrent Portfolio (after trade):\n- NVDA: 3 shares\n- GILD: 5 shares\n- QQQ: 1 share\n- AMD: 2 shares\n- Cash: â‚¬201.27\n\nStrategy for Next Steps:\n- Hold and monitor; portfolio is balanced and has room to act on new opportunities.\n- Await better market news access for future sessionsâ€™ momentum or breakout plays.\n- Preserve sufficient cash for agility while maximizing medium-term growth via current holdings.\n\nPerformance tracking and risk management remain on course!",
