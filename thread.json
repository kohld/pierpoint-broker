Will continue monitoring, prepared to adjust PEP or RCL positions or add to high-conviction names as new data emerges.\n\nPerformance tracking: Your portfolio is now ~â‚¬442.84 (cash) + â‚¬180.21 (NVDA) + â‚¬546.04 (QQQ) + â‚¬378.27 (PEP) + â‚¬501.62 (RCL) â‰ˆ â‚¬2,049, a healthy gain from the â‚¬1,000 starting capital.\n\nNext session, Iâ€™ll scan for breakout stocks and act quickly if new opportunities ariseâ€”or manage risk further if weakness persists in current holdings.\n\nStaying agile and ready for the next trade!",
