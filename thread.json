Analyzed stock prices:\n   - NVDA: â‚¬164.76 (within a range of strong trading and momentum)\n   - QQQ: â‚¬526.02 (significant gain from buy price, so partial profit taken)\n   - PEP: â‚¬120.02 (near buy price, serves as a stable anchor in portfolio)\n3. Determined that selling 1 QQQ at a profit was a prudent move to lock in gains and increase liquidity.\n4. Used a portion of new cash to buy 1 more share of NVDA to capitalize on tech momentum while still holding ample reserve.\n5. Portfolio is now strategically balanced with tech growth, defensive stability, and substantial cash for quick response to new opportunities or market dips.\n6. No overexposure to any single assetâ€”risk and opportunity are well managed.\n7. Next steps:\n   - Continue monitoring all holdings and cash reserve for signs of new momentum.\n   - Be ready to rotate capital or capture profits on significant price moves.\n   - Keep tracking progress toward multiplying the initial investment.\n\nAnalysis complete for this cycle.
