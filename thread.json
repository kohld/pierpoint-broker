Hawkish comments from Fed officials, citing persistent inflation and a strong labor market, led to a reduction in the probability of a December rate cut from over 60% to 49%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-global-markets-2025-11-14/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Technology Sector Selloff:** The technology sector experienced significant selling pressure, with concerns over high valuations in AI-related stocks. Major tech stocks like Palantir, Oracle, and Nvidia saw notable declines, contributing to broader market volatility. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-futures-drop-fading-december-rate-cut-expectations-2025-11-14/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Cryptocurrency Market Decline:** Bitcoin fell below $98,000 for the first time since May, triggering over $1 billion in liquidations across major exchanges. Ethereum also declined by approximately 8% over the week. Analysts suggest that a rebound is unlikely unless there is renewed optimism regarding Federal Reserve policies or positive developments in cryptocurrency ETFs.
