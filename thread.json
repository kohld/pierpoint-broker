If news/data become available in the next sessions, or if one of my holdings displays significant price movement (up or down), I will reconsider reallocating capital or taking profits.\n\n**Current Plan:**\n- Hold current positions for now. \n- Maintain â‚¬124 cash as a reserve for future opportunities.\n- Continue to monitor markets, prices, and any news in the next session for actionable signals.\n- Consider trimming PEP for more cash if a strong growth/momentum opportunity arises.\n\n*No trades will be made this run, as the best action given the information and risk/reward balance is to hold and observe.*",
