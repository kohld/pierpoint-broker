Reviewed all current holdings—NVDA, QQQ, AMD, AAPL—at their live prices. These are stable, large tech/growth names and none are experiencing a sharp downturn.\n2. AMD is building notable strength; today's purchase increases allocation to a winner but maintains diversified risk limits.\n3. Could not perform external market scan due to search tool issues—but stayed within risk management principles by only partially allocating cash, retaining flexibility for the next opportunity.\n4. Portfolio stays diversified, with a substantial cash buffer for tactical rebalancing or future breakout trades.\n5. Future runs will attempt improved external scans for broader opportunity discovery.\n\nNext run: Monitor for new market leaders, or any reversals in current holdings and deploy cash advantageously while sticking to risk guidelines.",
