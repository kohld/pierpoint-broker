Portfolio is performing very well and concentrated in large-cap tech.\n2. Without real-time news/top gainers (web search is down), there’s increased risk in making new sector bets blind.\n3. With such gains, it may be prudent to take partial profits on AMZN or GOOGL—both have appreciated significantly.\n4. Keeping a substantial cash reserve for risk management and future opportunities is wise, given limited market visibility.\n5. If no urgent negative news or sector rotation is found, the best move may be to hold, trim a position for risk control, or simply observe until market research capability is restored.\n\nDecision Options:\n- Sell 1 share of GOOGL or AMZN to crystallize profits and boost cash, reducing exposure slightly.\n- Hold current positions and wait for new information before making changes.\n\nWould you prefer I secure gains by selling a portion of GOOGL or AMZN, or maintain the current positions until new news becomes available? (If you want me to proceed with a specific action, just say so—or I can continue monitoring with current strategy!)",
