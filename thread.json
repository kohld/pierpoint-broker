Reviewed portfolio: \n   - Main holdings: NVDA, AMD, QQQ, GILD. \n   - All tech-heavy, GILD (biotech) underperforming.\n2. Checked current prices vs. purchase:\n   - NVDA (â‚¬145.93), AMD (â‚¬138.46), QQQ (â‚¬488.06), GILD (â‚¬96.53).\n   - All in slight drawdown except GILD, which was notably weak.\n3. Decided to free up capital by selling 5 shares of GILD at â‚¬96.53, raising â‚¬482.65 to redeploy.\n4. Prioritized sticking with relative strength in top tech (NVDA) for higher potential rebound/momentum.\n5. Purchased 3 additional shares of NVDA at â‚¬145.81 each (total â‚¬437.43).\n6. Maintained a cash buffer (â‚¬246.49) for flexibility if a new opportunity arises or if a market reversal demands action.\n7. Final assessment: Portfolio is now weighted toward NVDA, AMD, and QQQ (tech/momentum), positioned for a potential rally in leading tech names, with cash on hand for opportunistic trading.\n\n**Current Portfolio:**\n- NVDA: 6 shares\n- AMD: 2 shares\n- QQQ: 1 share\n- Cash: â‚¬246.49\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Monitor NVDA for breakout or reversal; consider profit-taking if there is a surge.\n- Stay attentive for sector news or broader market shifts in coming runs.\n- Remain ready to rebalance risk if NVDA or tech sector momentum wanes.\n\nPortfolio is positioned for growth while maintaining prudent reserves for tactical adjustments.",
