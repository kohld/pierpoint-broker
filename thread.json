All holdings are in profit and the portfolio is well-balanced but tech-heavy.\n2. Without new market or news data (due to search errors), the safest move is to lock some profit and reduce risk from the largest position (NVDA), while maintaining exposure if the rally continues.\n3. Keeping over â‚¬700 in cash ensures readiness for fast moves on any upcoming trade opportunities as market signals or news become available.\n4. Monitor for sector rotation, technical breakouts, or news-driven momentum for next rebalancing or aggressive trades.\n\n**Action Taken:** Trimmed NVDA position to secure gains and maintain flexibility. Standing by for new information before additional trades.\n\nIf new market data or trends emerge later today, I will reassess for further opportunities!",
