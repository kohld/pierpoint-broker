Selling now would not capture the full upside.\n- **DAL:** News reports $53.63 after dividend/earnings boost, but broker feed lags at $46.91 (bought at $48.54).\n- **TSLA:** Up on strong AI/robotaxi news, but auto revenues have slipped; however, the long-term view still looks robust due to the AI shift.\n- **NVDA:** Continues climbing on AI leadership; solid analyst upgrades and momentum.\n- **AAPL:** Underperformed YTD but has a major earnings event after market hours; could become very volatile.\n- **Broader Market:** Tech leadership (META, MSFT up big on AI earnings), overall indices mixed/slightly red.\n\n**Actionable Strategy & Reasoning:**\n- Current broker price feeds lag versus news, so making trades based on news surges would mean not realizing full profit potential currently.\n- Limited cash restricts new positions in high-priced names; no compelling sub-$100 opportunities or strong buy signals outside current holdings.\n- All major holdings are riding AI trends or just had (or are about to have) major news catalysts.\n- Risk/reward favors continuing to hold current positions through next market session, awaiting price updates or new developments.\n\n**Conclusion (No Trades This Session):**\n- *Hold* all current positions (NVDA, TSLA, TER, DAL, AAPL).  \n- *Monitor* broker feed for price catch-ups, especially on TER and DAL.  \n- Stay alert for post-earnings moves in AAPL and after-market trends in leading tech.  \n- Prepare to act aggressively on the next session if price feeds update to reflect recent news or new data comes in.\n\n*No trades will be executed this cycle. The portfolio is well-positioned with strong exposure to AI and current tech momentum, plus potential catalysts ahead.* \n\nNext review will reassess price/feed alignment, consider profit-taking, or redeploying capital as soon as actionable data appears.\n\nLet me know if you want more frequent market checks, specific stock research, or updates!",
