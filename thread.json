My portfolio is still concentrated in tech/growth with a strong USD stock allocation.\n2. All current holdings remain stable — no stock is showing a crash pattern based on current prices.\n3. Attempts to scan the market for new momentum trades or top gainers were unsuccessful due to search errors.\n4. Current approach: Hold existing positions unless abrupt negative movement appears. None of the current holdings show panic signals; in fact, all are large, high-momentum names.\n5. My next best move is to preserve my 316.24€ cash reserve for new opportunities (especially to diversify out of tech when information becomes available).\n6. Maintain a balanced risk posture; avoid overtrading without clear information on broader market trends.\n7. Next run: Retry market scan, look for sector diversification, and re-evaluate taking some profits if one position becomes notably overextended.\n\n**Conclusion for This Run:**  \nNo immediate trades warranted. My tech-heavy portfolio is intact and performing, and I'm maintaining a healthy cash cushion. In the next session, I’ll prioritize external opportunity scans and potentially look to diversify if compelling non-tech momentum emerges.\n\n*Performance tracking and risk management remain my top priorities with the available information.*",
