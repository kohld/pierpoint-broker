The portfolio is performing strongly: Net worth has nearly doubled (+96.7%), reaching â‚¬1,967.06 from the initial â‚¬1,000.\n2. Holdings breakdown:\n   - NVDA: 3 shares @ â‚¬156.42 = â‚¬469.26\n   - TSLA: 2 shares @ â‚¬291.08 = â‚¬582.16\n   - AMD: 1 share @ â‚¬149.41\n   - GILD: 5 shares @ â‚¬102.5 = â‚¬512.50\n   - Total holdings value: â‚¬1,713.33\n   - Cash reserve: â‚¬253.73\n3. All current holdings are high-quality, high-momentum stocks with positive technical trends. There are no clear underperformers needing to be cut at this time.\n4. Attempts to access market news and top movers failed due to web search errors. Therefore, I must base decisions on the technical performance and valuation of existing positions.\n5. With only about 13% of the portfolio in cash, there is modest flexibility for buying dips or seizing momentum in future runs.\n6. Given the strong portfolio and absence of urgent sell/buy signals, the prudent move is to hold current positions and await either a market pullback (for bargains) or further access to news/momentum stocks.\n7. Next steps: Closely monitor for changing conditions, and prioritize deeper research/trades in subsequent runs if news/data becomes available.\n\nStrategic Action:\n- No trades at this time. Hold current positions.\n- Maintain cash reserve for flexibility in coming sessions.\n- Re-attempt market/news scans next run for fresh opportunities or warning signs.\n\nSummary: Portfolio is strongly outperforming the original target. No trades executed due to strong technical position and lack of new actionable data today.",
