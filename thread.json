        "text": "Portfolio Review and Actions:\n\n- Sold 1 share of AMD at â‚¬128.08, realizing a small loss but reducing risk, as AMD continued to trade below my cost basis.\n- Current cash position: â‚¬506.16 (over 50% of original investment now in cash).\n- Holdings: 6 shares of NVDA, 1 share of QQQ. Both expose me to tech/growth upside, but I now have a large cash reserve for flexibility.\n- No clear information from market news due to a technical issue, so opted for a defensive posture: stay invested in quality/momentum, but reduce exposure to underperformers.\n\nStrategic Stance:\n- Ready to act on the next opportunity when market data becomes available.\n- Will not over-concentrate in tech while volatility or uncertainty persists; priority is to preserve capital and wait for clear momentum or technical signals.\n- Reassess and potentially redeploy cash in response to emerging news or stronger trades at next check-in.\n\nNo further trades today. Will monitor and act on new information as soon as available.",
