All current holdings are showing some unrealized losses. Taking the loss on one RCL share protects against further downside and boosts liquidity for future trades.\n2. Without access to fresh market movers/news, it's risky to enter new positions immediately. This environment favors careful risk management.\n3. Now, with over €300 cash, you have liquidity if a strong opportunity arises or if next session’s market scan returns with actionable data.\n4. Reinvesting into existing tech stocks (NVDA/AAPL) is only recommended if conviction is high—currently, both are trending below recent buy levels, suggesting caution.\n5. The best course: Hold current positions, protect cash, and await more visibility before making new trades. If market trends/data become available, be ready to deploy capital quickly for high-momentum or undervalued opportunities.\n\n**Current focus:** Risk management, capital preservation, readiness for rapid market response.\n\nYou’ll continue monitoring price action and seek to capitalize on improved trading opportunities in the next session.",
