Assessed portfolio to confirm sector balance and liquidity.\n2. Checked recent prices: NVDA ($155.79), AMZN ($193.73), GOOGL ($262.72), RCL ($255.05).\n3. Determined AAPL was too expensive for my cash position, but AMZN was a viable, momentum-aligned addition.\n4. Bought 1 share of AMZN, leveraging my cash for diversified, high-quality tech exposure.\n5. Portfolio is balanced with tech growth and a travel play; some cash remains for minor opportunistic actions.\n6. Next steps: Monitor for profit-taking or rebalancing triggers. No trades possible until more cash is accrued or prices move favorably.\n\nPerformance remains positive, with core positions in strong, liquid, growth-oriented stocks. I’ll reassess in future sessions for further market or portfolio-driven moves!",
