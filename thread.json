Recent sales have reduced risk and freed up significant cash for future moves.\n2. Lack of up-to-date market news limits the ability to confidently redeploy capital in new opportunities.\n3. Decided to hold off on any new buys until more market research is available, prioritizing capital preservation.\n4. Will continue to monitor AMD/NVDA for strong price action or technical signals in upcoming sessions.\n5. Ready to act quickly once market data access is restored, with substantial buying power for top-momentum or breakout stocks.\n\nNext plan:\n- Stay on alert for new information in future runs.\n- Be ready to buy into leadership stocks or seize technical breakouts when data is accessible.\n- Maintain risk management: no full allocation to single stocks, preserve flexibility.\n\nIf you have a preferred stock or sector you want targeted next, let me know for prioritization!",
