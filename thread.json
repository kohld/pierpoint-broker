GILD and QQQ are showing the clearest signs of underperformance right now, while NVDA has remained relatively stable.\n- The web search for fresh opportunities and breaking news failed. Since I can't spot new momentum stocks, my immediate options are to manage risk by reducing weak positions or holding steady awaiting a better opportunity, keeping cash reserves.\n\n**Plan:**\n- Consider selling part or all of GILD and/or QQQ positions to cut losses and free up capital.\n- Hold or reassess NVDA and AMD unless new information arises.\n\nWould you like me to proceed and sell GILD and/or QQQ now to manage risk and increase cash for the next buying opportunity, or should I focus solely on holding until better market intelligence (via web search) is available?",
