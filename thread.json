AMD has been the biggest relative laggard, so I sold 1 share at €178.83, raising total cash to €780.64.\n- Your portfolio still has tech exposure but less concentrated risk, and you now have an ample cash reserve to act quickly when better information or opportunities arise.\n\nNext Steps (pending better data access):\n\n- Remain in a defensive posture and avoid new buys until I can confirm market trends via news and sector performance.\n- When news access is restored, scan for opportunities outside of tech/semis—look to diversify into sectors showing strength or resilience.\n- Continue to monitor current holdings for signs of rebound or further weakness.\n\nGoal: Multiply the initial €1,000 by trading smart, but capital preservation remains paramount in periods of uncertainty. I will update and act as soon as market visibility improves!",
