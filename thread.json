This aligns with a compounding approach: adding to winners when they show sustained strength.\n- With QQQ and PEP already held, this keeps some diversification between high-growth tech and stable consumer sectors.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Monitor NVDA for signs of reversal, profit-taking opportunities, or need to rebalance if it becomes overweight.\n- Watch for opportunities to redeploy remaining cash, particularly if new leaders emerge or if current holdings stall.\n- Upon restoration of web search, scan for fresh market news and new momentum plays.\n\nPerformance tracking and risk management remain prioritiesâ€”continuing to compound gains while protecting the initial â‚¬1000 capital. Ready for the next trading window!",
