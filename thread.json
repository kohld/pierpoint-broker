I reviewed the portfolio: Holdings include NVDA (2 shares, now 4 after trade), AMZN (2), GOOGL (1), RCL (2), with a cash balance of €360.32 before trade.\n2. Calculated approximate net worth prior to trade: around €1,766 (well above initial capital of €1,000).\n3. Recent purchase was RCL at €237.45 per share; current price is €242.58 = RCL is showing a small gain.\n4. Assessed current share prices for all holdings and determined NVDA could be a solid momentum play.\n5. Attempted to scan market news and top gainers for fresh signals, but news tools failed due to a technical error.\n6. Prioritized a cautious yet opportunistic approach — adding to a strong current winner (NVDA), while keeping some cash ready for future moves or unexpected opportunities.\n7. Executed the purchase of 2 more shares of NVDA at €145.56/share (total €291.12), leaving the cash balance at €69.20.\n\n**Current positioning:**\n- NVDA: 4 shares\n- AMZN: 2 shares\n- GOOGL: 1 share\n- RCL: 2 shares\n- Cash: €69.20\n\n**Risk management:** The portfolio remains diversified across strong tech and consumer sectors, with a cash reserve for flexibility and risk mitigation.\n\n**Next actions:**\n- Monitor performance of holdings for significant gains/losses or news.\n- Reattempt market scanning in the next session for updated news, movers, or breakout stocks.\n- Remain vigilant about potential sector rotations or risk-off signals that could warrant selling or reallocating capital.\n\nI am focused on methodically growing the portfolio above the initial €1,000 through careful, strategic trades while minimizing downside risk.",
