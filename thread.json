RCL has delivered strong gains. Partial profit-taking (sold 1 share) locks in returns and reduces risk exposure.\n2. Portfolio remains diversified (tech + travel/leisure), with cash now ready for a fresh buy.\n3. Without live news access, avoid speculative buys; maintaining cash is prudent until actionable data returns.\n4. Continue holding NVDA and AMZN unless negative news or significant downward movement emerges—they're stable, growth-oriented plays.\n5. Next move: On the next analysis cycle, aggressively seek market news on top movers and sector leaders.
