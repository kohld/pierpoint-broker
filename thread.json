Your portfolio is highly successful right now, primarily concentrated in high-momentum, tech-heavy names (NVDA and QQQ).\n2. PEP, a stable blue-chip, offers modest diversification but is a small part of the portfolio.\n3. Cash on hand is limited. With a â‚¬1 per order fee, small trades will not have much impact, so only high-conviction moves are worthwhile.\n4. Market news and sector momentum could not be refreshed due to technical issues, so no drastic moves should be made without new data unless price action shows urgency.\n5. Current prices show stable-to-strong performance; no abrupt drops observed in any holding.\n6. Risks: Heavy exposure to tech/growth sectorâ€”watch for pullbacks or sector rotation.\n\nStrategic Decision:\n- Hold all positions for now as the best risk/reward course of action.\n- Wait for either a new high-conviction opportunity (triggered by news/price breakthrough when web search resumes) or a clear reason to exit/rebalance (price collapse or rotation into a new winner).\n- Re-evaluate at the next scheduled check or sooner if data feed returns.\n\nPerformance remains strong, and discipline is maintained by not forcing trades with low impact relative to fees and risk.",
