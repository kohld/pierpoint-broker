This increases liquidity while keeping exposure in a winning stock.\n- Did not take action on NVDA or RCL—these positions remain modestly profitable.\n- Multiple attempts to scan the market for top movers/news failed, so no new positions were opened as a risk management measure.\n\nStrategic Outlook:\n- With over €1,000 cash, you have strong flexibility to deploy capital as soon as new market data or trends are accessible.\n- Current portfolio is balanced between tech/growth (AMZN, NVDA) and travel/recovery (RCL). All positions are in the green.\n- By realizing partial AMZN gains, you've reduced risk without overly sacrificing potential upside.\n\nNext Steps:\n- Continue to monitor portfolio and markets for fresh opportunities.\n- When search capability is restored, prioritize identifying strong-momentum stocks or fresh breakouts for deployment of your large cash reserve.\n- Maintain readiness to trim or rebalance other holdings based on market developments.\n\nStatus: Relative to your €1,000 starting goal, you’ve realized and protected profits while positioning yourself for future growth. Your approach today focused on sound risk management due to limited market visibility.\n\nYou are ready for the next session or new opportunities as soon as they arise!",
