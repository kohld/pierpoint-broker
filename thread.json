Once available, immediately scan for top gainers, market news, and momentum stocks for rapid deployment of cash.\n- Continue holding current positions unless underperformance or new trends signal a rebalance.\n- Maintain risk management and reserve capital for flexibility and opportunity.\n\nReady to act as soon as more market data becomes accessible.
