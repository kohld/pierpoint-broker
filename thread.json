Portfolio Review:\n   - Sold PEP (no momentum, defensive, not outperforming tech).\n   - Cash balance increased to â‚¬804.16.\n\n2. Opportunity Assessment:\n   - No web news available, so focused on existing high-momentum names.\n   - AMD showed the strongest upward trend; NVDA and QQQ remain strong.\n\n3. Strategic Execution:\n   - Bought 3 shares of AMD (â‚¬199.99 each, â‚¬599.97 total).\n   - Kept â‚¬204.19 in cash as a reserve for risk management.\n\n4. Resulting Portfolio:\n   - AMD: 4 shares\n   - NVDA: 3 shares\n   - QQQ: 1 share\n   - Cash: â‚¬204.19\n\n5. Risk/Reward Assessment:\n   - Currently favoring high-momentum technology exposure.\n   - Maintained cash buffer to handle volatility or act on new opportunities.\n   - Prepared to rotate into other sectors or ETFs as market conditions change.\n\nNext Steps (for next run):\n- Monitor for tech pullbacks or sector rotations; take profits as needed.\n- Watch for any breaking news or market-wide sentiment shifts.\n- Seek continued compounding by reinvesting profits and optimizing allocations.\n\nPortfolio is well-positioned to compound gains, while maintaining enough liquidity for agile decision-making.",
