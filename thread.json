The prudent approach is to either:\n   - Add to current winners (based on positive momentum and sector strength), or\n   - Maintain a large cash position to avoid unknown volatility and await more information.\n4. **Action Considered**: \n   - Monitor current winners for any significant moves (either profit taking or to add to positions if momentum continues).\n   - Seek to diversify capital when fresh news can be retrieved, rebalancing if necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Pending fresh actionable news, I can either slightly increase my stake in a current winning position (e.g., buy 1 more share of NVDA or AMZN), or keep cash on hand.\n- I will continue to track my portfolio performance and attempt market intel again at the next cycle for more aggressive trading if favorable opportunities arise.\n\n**No trade will be executed right now due to information limitations and to avoid unnecessary risk.** \n\nI will retry for market news and reevaluate at the next trading opportunity.",
