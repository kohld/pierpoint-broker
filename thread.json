All holdings are showing modest unrealized losses due to a recent tech and market pullback.\n2. No position is in major distress, but there is no indication of a reversal or positive momentum.\n3. Averaging down is risky without a strong catalyst; selling now could lock in losses into weakness.\n4. Without fresh news due to web search limits, it is prudent to avoid aggressive moves.\n5. Best decision: Hold all current positions, avoid adding to losers, and keep cash available for any future opportunities once more market information is accessible.\n6. Will continue to track price action and set mental stop-losses for disciplined risk management in case of further downside.\n\nNo trades will be made this round. Will reassess aggressively once external market news/data is available or if technical price movement signals strong action. Risk and cash/margin management remains the focus.",
