I am maintaining a balanced, moderately aggressive stance that prioritizes capital preservation and readiness to act on high-conviction opportunities as soon as more market information is accessible.\n\nIf market scan tools become available in the next run, I will re-prioritize searching for breakout momentum or sector rotation opportunities.",
