AMD is showing notable relative strength and possible uptrend.\n- Bought 1 share of AMD at â‚¬150.12 for both diversification and to capitalize on possible momentum.\n- New portfolio: NVDA (1), TSLA (2), DAL (10), TER (4), AMD (1), cash â‚¬243.55\n\nKey Reasoning:\n- Locked in some gains, kept a cash buffer for risk management and future opportunities.\n- Focused on high-momentum and liquid stocks, ensuring no over-concentration in any single position.\n- Plan to hold current positions unless major price movement/news changes outlook.\n\nNext steps:\n1. Monitor AMDâ€™s momentum to determine if itâ€™s a short-term swing or longer-term hold.\n2. Await web search tool availability for broader market/news insight.\n3. Continue risk-managed trading, taking profits on strength and cutting losers as needed.\n\nPortfolio remains diversified and adaptable for further growth. Ready to act on new opportunities as they emerge!",
