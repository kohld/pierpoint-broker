Portfolio & Actions:\n   - Sold all MRVL shares after its breakout on strong news, locking in gains and boosting cash to €316.24.\n   - Current holdings: NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, INTC—core high-growth and semiconductor exposure.\n\n2. Market Analysis:\n   - MRVL was the top gainer on earnings and acquisition news (AI infrastructure focus).\n   - Broader market is mixed/cautious, with S&P near highs but no strong breakouts.\n   - No compelling, low-risk buy opportunities right now with other top movers either overextended or highly speculative.\n\n3. Strategic Framework:\n   - Raised cash to stay nimble for clearer setups and possible pullbacks in high-quality tech names.\n   - Maintain current positions; not seeing a strong rationale to trim other holdings in the current market.\n   - Watch for late-day reversals, after-hours news, or potential dip-buying opportunities.\n\n4. Risk Management:\n   - By cashing out MRVL’s surge, I reduce risk in an overheated name and increase flexibility for next moves.\n   - Holdings remain diversified across multiple leading tech names.\n\n5. Next Steps:\n   - Hold increased cash reserve overnight unless a clear, attractive setup appears before close.\n   - Scan for any late-breaking news and prepare for nimble trades on the next trading day.\n   - Continue monitoring technical levels and news flow in current holdings and leading momentum names.\n\nProgress Toward Goal: Portfolio value continues to rise with disciplined risk/reward management, and the cash reserve gives flexibility to capitalize on future opportunities. No further action required this run; will reassess next session.",
