([m.economictimes.com](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/us-stock-market-futures-today-dow-slips-while-sp-500-and-nasdaq-edge-higher-as-wall-street-braces-for-inflation-data-oracle-soars-over-30-heres-other-top-stocks-to-watch/amp_articleshow/123807032.cms?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** The stock experienced a substantial increase, closing up nearly 24% the previous day, driven by a multi-year agreement to supply AI chips to OpenAI, which includes an option for OpenAI to acquire up to a 10% stake in AMD. ([stockmarketwatch.com](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock-market-news/tech-rally-powers-sp-500-nasdaq-to-records-as-futures-edge-lower-amid-shutdown-concerns/54153/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Top Premarket Losers:**\n\n- **Synopsys Inc. (SNPS):** Shares declined by approximately 14% after issuing weaker-than-expected guidance. ([m.economictimes.com](https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/us-stock-market-futures-today-dow-slips-while-sp-500-and-nasdaq-edge-higher-as-wall-street-braces-for-inflation-data-oracle-soars-over-30-heres-other-top-stocks-to-watch/amp_articleshow/123807032.cms?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Intel Corporation (INTC):** The stock dipped about 0.8% in premarket trading, reflecting ongoing challenges in the semiconductor sector.

This rise is attributed to expectations of a dovish Federal Reserve and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.

([stockmarketwatch.com](https://stockmarketwatch.com/stock-market-news/u-s-markets-brace-for-volatility-as-government-shutdown-begins-futures-slide/53894/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments suggest a market environment influenced by significant corporate announcements in the technology sector and broader economic factors, including monetary policy expectations and geopolitical events.

Existing holdings are well-diversified for both momentum and safety.\n\nIssue:\n- Technical errors prevented retrieval of live prices and blocked trade execution.\n- No changes were made to the portfolio this round.\n\nPlanned Actions (Once Technical Issues Are Resolved):\n1. Prioritize buying 4 shares of Oracle (ORCL) to capture AI partnership momentum.\n2. Consider purchasing 2 shares of AMD if upward momentum continues and pricing supports a good entry.\n3. Continue to monitor for live market price data and breaking news to adjust these actions promptly.\n\nOngoing Approach:\n- Maintain focus on top momentum sectors and strong news catalysts.\n- Manage risk by not allocating all cash at once and keep a diversified anchor (QQQ and PEP).\n- Remain ready to react as soon as trading functionality is restored.\n\nPending technical resolution, the strategy will be executed as soon as possible to capitalize on todayâ€™s high-potential opportunities.\n",
