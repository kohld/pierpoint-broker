That limits my ability to pivot quickly to a surging opportunity.\n\nLogical next steps:\n- RCL is the weakest position with further downside risk and a big underperformance relative to other names. Selling part or all of RCL would free up meaningful cash for a new trade if an opportunity is found.\n- NVDA and AAPL have less steep drawdowns and greater upside potential, so those are candidates for holding.\n- For now, it's prudent to watch for further price movement—they could turn around within today—or take action if risk increases.\n\nI'll reassess soon, continue to look for new market leaders or strong news, and consider selling 1-2 RCL shares at the next decision point if no rebound appears.
