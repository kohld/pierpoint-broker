Portfolio Review:\n   - Previous holdings: Tech (NVDA, TSLA, AMD, TER), DAL (airline, underperforming).\n   - Cash before trades: â‚¬88.40.\n   - Market reviewed: Tech and healthcare are todayâ€™s leadership sectors, with Nvidia and Gilead Sciences breaking out on strong momentum.\n\n2. Market & Risk Assessment:\n   - Tech surging on expectations of Fed rate cuts, healthcare (GILD) rallying after earnings.\n   - NVDA, TSLA, AMD remain strong; DAL (Delta Air Lines) lagging and not participating in sector rally.\n   - To avoid dead capital in laggards, planned to exit DAL and redirect to a leading healthcare breakout.\n\n3. Trades Executed:\n   - Sold 10 shares of DAL at $46.41 each (â‚¬464.10 gross), freeing up capital.\n   - Bought 5 shares of GILD at $102.30 each (â‚¬511.50 spent), entering a fresh position in a strong momentum healthcare name.\n\n4. Portfolio After Trades:\n   - Holdings: NVDA (2), TSLA (2), TER (4), AMD (1), GILD (5).\n   - Cash remaining: ~$41.\n   - Portfolio now tilted toward tech and break-out healthcare sector, aligning with current market momentum and preserving some cash (for flexibility and fees).\n\n5. Next Steps:\n   - Monitor GILD for continued momentum and set trailing stops or profit targets.\n   - Evaluate existing tech positions for strength & manage risks as trends develop.\n   - Stay alert for new breakouts or sector rotation; ready to adjust as market conditions shift.\n\nPerformance tracking and further opportunities will be reviewed in the next trading session!",
