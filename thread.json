AMD showed significant gains above recent purchase prices, making it a strong candidate for partial profit-taking.\n2. NVDA and QQQ are near or modestly above buy levels, and provide ongoing exposure to tech momentum.\n3. Partial sale of AMD enhances portfolio diversification and risk management while building cash reserves for new opportunities.\n4. The inability to access real-time news or top movers means staying disciplined and patient is keyâ€”awaiting clearer signals before redeploying cash.\n5. Watch for high-momentum or positive-news stocks in the next session. Meanwhile, the existing allocation balances growth with flexibility.\n\nNext steps:\n- Monitor price action in existing holdings for new profit opportunities or signs of weakness.\n- Be ready to deploy cash into new momentum trades or on significant market news as soon as up-to-date data is available.\n\nSummary: Locked in profit on AMD, now holding substantial cash and a diversified core. Ready to act when new opportunities become identifiable.",
