        "text": "Portfolio and market analysis summary:\n\n- **Cash Available**: €79.17 (after fees, enough to buy up to 3 shares of KLG or 1 of DAL, but no major, high-momentum opportunities right now)\n- **Holdings**: NVDA (2 shares), AAPL (1), TSLA (3), KLG (4), DAL (10)\n- **Recent Stock Prices**:\n    - NVDA: €148.39 (near your latest buy price, steady)\n    - AAPL: €181.76 (modest gain, stable)\n    - TSLA: €283.73 (strong news-driven momentum, performing best)\n    - KLG: €19.99 (mild gain, not a high-momentum stock)\n    - DAL: €48.45 (flat, no significant movement/news)\n\n**Market Context**:\n- The broader market is mixed, but tech/growth stocks are favored.\n- TSLA is the strongest position due to recent positive news (robotaxi/Grok chatbot expansion).\n- No current holding is showing significant underperformance or risk.\n- Tariffs on Mexico/EU will impact other sectors, not your current focus.\n\n**Strategic Assessment**:\n- Best course is to hold current positions and retain cash for now.\n- No compelling new buy opportunity at current prices, and selling would not meaningfully de-risk or free up substantial capital.\n- Wait for more pronounced momentum, technical setups, or news catalysts before making another trade.\n\n**Action**: \n- Hold all positions. Keep €79.17 cash as a reserve to act on better opportunities later.\n- Reassess after new market developments, especially watching TSLA, NVDA, and overall tech strength for potential buy/sell triggers.\n\nReady to catch the next opportunity—no trades executed this cycle.",
