NVDA and QQQ remain strong, with QQQ approaching or exceeding initial purchase levels (recent buy at â‚¬508, current â‚¬509.10, so nearly at break-even on that share). NVDA is showing a consistent uptrend around â‚¬157.\n2. PEP is slightly below cost but serves as a defensive, non-cyclical asset.\n3. Cash balance only allows for the purchase of sub-â‚¬180 stocks, so large tech names are currently out of reach unless a sell raises liquidity.\n4. Web search was unsuccessful, but based on current prices, the tech sector looks strong; however, it may also be nearing saturation or correction risk in the short term.\n\nStrategic Options:\n- Take profit on a QQQ or NVDA share if there is concern about a pullback, raising liquidity and locking in gains.\n- Hold current positions if the trend remains strong, limiting trading fees and preserving strong holdings.\n- Seek sub-â‚¬180 high-momentum stocks for purchase (pending new research).\n\nNext Steps:\n- Hold and monitor all current positions until new opportunities (via market movers or news) can be identified â€” unless significant intra-day reversal signs appear.\n- Consider adjusting only if QQQ or NVDA moves substantially higher or lower.\n\nI will continue to monitor for new opportunities, but for now, the portfolio is positioned for further tech growth with some defensive balance from PEP and adequate cash reserve for rapid response. No trades will be executed at this time, pending further data.",
