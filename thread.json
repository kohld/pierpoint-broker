President Donald Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese exports and impending export controls on key software, responding to China's restrictions on rare earth material exports. This led to a sharp decline in Chinese markets:\n\n- **CSI300 Index**: down 1.8%\n- **Shanghai Composite**: down 1.3%\n- **Hang Seng Index**: down 3.5%\n- **Hang Seng Tech Index**: down 4.5%\n\nDespite the downturn, China's rare earth and semiconductor stocks rose due to their strategic importance in the trade conflict. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/revived-us-trade-war-set-knock-chinas-stocks-lofty-peaks-2025-10-13/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the U.S., major indices also declined:\n\n- **S&P 500**: down 2.7%\n- **Nasdaq**: down 3.6%\n- **Dow Jones Industrial Average**: down 1.9%\n\nThis marked Wall Street's worst day since April, driven by concerns over the escalating trade dispute and its potential impact on technology sectors reliant on rare earth materials.

However, the bond market was closed in observance of the holiday. ([kiplinger.com](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/is-the-stock-market-closed-on-columbus-day?utm_source=openai))\n\nOverall, the day's market movements were heavily influenced by geopolitical developments, particularly the renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China, leading to significant declines across major global indices.\n\n\n## Global Markets React to Renewed U.S.-China Trade Tensions:\n- [China's stocks sink on fresh US trade war salvo](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/revived-us-trade-war-set-knock-chinas-stocks-lofty-peaks-2025-10-13/?utm_source=openai), Published on Sunday, October 12\n- [Asian shares skid after Wall Street tumbles to its worst day since April as China trade woes worsen](https://apnews.com/article/d56af8591bbf90372f95f9a4293ee787?utm_source=openai), Published on Sunday, October 12\n- [Wall Street tumbles to its worst day since April after Trump threatens more tariffs on China](https://apnews.com/article/f2c8bcc1f46043ab504cf4b0281e3401?utm_source=openai), Published on Thursday, October 09 "

      "text": "As of October 13, 2025, U.S. stock market premarket activity in the semiconductor, rare earth, and defense sectors reflects significant movements influenced by recent geopolitical developments.\n\n**Semiconductor Sector:**\n\n- **Advanced Micro Devices (AMD):** Shares surged over 30% in premarket trading following the announcement of a multi-year deal to supply AI chips to OpenAI, potentially generating tens of billions in annual revenue. ([itiger.com](https://www.itiger.com/news/1190411952?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Applied Materials:** The company's stock declined approximately 3% premarket after forecasting a $600 million revenue impact due to expanded U.S. export restrictions affecting semiconductor equipment sales to China. ([itiger.com](https://www.itiger.com/news/1106694677?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Rare Earth Sector:**\n\n- **Critical Metals:** Shares soared over 70% premarket amid reports that the U.S. government is considering acquiring an equity stake in the company, which owns Greenland's largest rare earth project. ([itiger.com](https://www.itiger.com/news/1190411952?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **USA Rare Earth (USAR):** The stock experienced a 9% increase in premarket trading, continuing its upward trend driven by strategic partnerships and heightened demand for rare earth materials. ([itiger.com](https://www.itiger.com/news/1106694677?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Defense Sector:**\n\n- **iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA):** The ETF is trading at $206.04, down 2.5% from the previous close, reflecting broader market concerns amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions.\n\nThese movements are largely influenced by recent geopolitical events, including the U.S. imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese imports and China's tightening of rare earth export controls, which have significantly impacted market dynamics across these sectors. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-index-futures-tick-up-ahead-consumer-sentiment-data-2025-10-10/?utm_source=openai))\n\n*Please note that premarket trading is subject to rapid changes, and it's advisable to consult real-time sources for the most current information.* "
