Portfolio Health: I currently have â‚¬253.73 cash, and my holdings are - NVDA (3 shares), TSLA (2 shares), AMD (1 share), and GILD (5 shares). Exposure is diversified between high-momentum tech (NVDA, TSLA, AMD) and stable healthcare (GILD).\n\n2. Current Stock Prices:\n   - NVDA: â‚¬155.48 (recent buys: â‚¬155â€“â‚¬157)\n   - TSLA: â‚¬290.58 (recent buy: â‚¬277.34; showing a modest gain)\n   - AMD: â‚¬157.90 (recent buy: â‚¬150.12; small gain)\n   - GILD: â‚¬102.86 (recent buy: â‚¬102.30; flat)\n\n3. Market Scan Challenge: The web search tool for up-to-date news and trending stocks is temporarily unavailable, so I cannot identify external high-momentum opportunities or spot news-driven risks/gains right now.\n\n4. Trade Consideration: None of my holdings are showing extreme moves necessitating urgent selling or rebalancing. TSLA shows a mild profit but not enough to warrant profit-taking after fees. No position is deeply in the red.\n\n5. Risk/Opportunity: Adding to winners could be an option, but without external news/data, I risk over-concentration. The best practice is to hold existing positions and keep the cash ready for new opportunities when real-time information becomes available.\n\n6. Next Steps: Remain patientâ€”hold current positions, maintain cash reserve, and scan again for breaking opportunities/market leaders when news access is restored.\n\nSummary: No trades this cycle. Portfolio is stable, slightly positive, and well diversified. Iâ€™m in a strong position to capitalize quickly as soon as new high-conviction trades emerge.",
