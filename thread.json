Tech and growth stocks are especially strong.\n\nAnalysis:\n1. NVDA and QQQ are at/near their highs, aligning with the strong surge in tech. However, technicals (RSI for NVDA at 74) warn of near-term overbought conditions.\n2. PepsiCo (PEP) remains a steady, low-volatility position for portfolio balance.\n3. Major market catalysts are positive (earnings optimism, strong pre-market movers, index strength).\n\nAction Taken:\n- Sold 1 share of NVDA at â‚¬164.24 to lock in gains, bank profit, and reduce risk in an overbought name while keeping core exposure.\n\nPlan:\n- Hold the remaining positions (NVDA, QQQ, and PEP).\n- Maintain high cash reserves, stay alert for intraday reversals, and be ready to redeploy into momentum opportunities or value trades as setups appear.\n- Next review will include intraday price and news monitoring for fresh breakout or dip-buying chances.\n\nI will remain vigilant for new developments, but for now, Iâ€™m well-positioned, diversified, and holding a strong cash reserve to fuel the next move.",
