If access to live news and top movers resumes, I will seek a high-momentum trade or attractive setup.\n- For now, the portfolio is healthy, diversified, and ready to react quickly as soon as fresh data is available.\n\nI will repeat this process at the next scheduled check, prioritizing fresh news, market movers, and trade opportunities to keep growing the account while managing risk.",
